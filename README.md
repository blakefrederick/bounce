I saw an Instagram reel that I found to be remarkably funny given that it was just boxes bouncing back and forth. So I decided to recreate that little animation (it's [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzINd8zsNxi)) for fun and lo and behold a very similar ending sequence just happens to take place.

Thanks https://github.com/fuhton/piano-mp3 for the audio notes though I'd like to replace these sounds with something more musical.

Needs fixing:
- Page has to be clicked else no audio plays
